# 🤝 Connectify — Bridging Influencers and Startups

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Most businesses — especially **startups** — struggle with promoting their products due to limited marketing budgets.

At the same time, **social media influencers** often need consistent income to continue pursuing their passion and creating content.

## 💡 The Idea

**Connectify** aims to connect **startups** with **influencers**, enabling both sides to benefit:

- ✅ Startups get affordable promotion for their products.
- ✅ Influencers get paid for doing what they love.
- ✅ We manage the connection and take a small **commission** from each transaction.

## 🔗 Our Goal

Build a platform where:
- 🤝 Influencers and business owners can register and match based on interests and niche.
- 💬 Transparent communication and collaboration is facilitated.
- 💸 Payments are processed securely with a small commission to sustain the platform.
